parrot-linear-algebra

A linear algebra library package for the Parrot Virtual Machine

== PROJECT GOALS

The goals of the Parrot-Linear-Algebra (PLA) project are to develop a good,
high-performance linear algebra toolset for use with the Parrot Virtual
Machine, and programs that run on top of Parrot. In pursuit of these goals,
high-performance PMC matrix types will be developed, along with interfaces
to the BLAS and LAPACK libraries for high-performance operations.

In addition to these core goals, PLA may also provide a series of ancillary
tools that are similar in implementation to it's high-performance core
utilities.

== STATUS

PLA is being actively developed. It has core PMC types that build, a build
and installation system, and a growing test suite.

== DEPENDENCIES

Currently depends on Parrot (Version 1.6.0 or higher), make, and CBLAS 
(or ATLAS with the CBLAS-like bindings). On Ubuntu or other Debian-based
distros, you can type this incantation:

sudo apt-get install libatlas3-base
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev

On Fedoa you can type:

sudo yum install atlas-devel

Notice that the default vesions of the atlas library are only generally 
optimized. If you are able try to use a platform-specific variant (such
as "-sse2" or "-3dnow") for better performance.

== BUILDING

To get, build, test, and install Parrot-Linear-Algebra, follow these steps
(on Linux):

git clone git://github.com/Whiteknight/parrot-linear-algebra.git pla
cd pla
parrot-nqp Configure.nqp
make && make test && sudo make install

NOTICE: Installation is slightly broken right now, you may need to install it
before you can test it (If testing fails, uninstall).

NOTICE: On Fedora yum installs to /usr/lib/atlas. You may need to modify the
makefile after configuration to include the flag "-L/usr/lib/atlas". You may
also need to modify the linker arguments to link against "-lcblas" instead of
"-lblas" on debian-based systems.

== CREDITS

Original versions were developed as part of the Matrixy project by Blairuk.
