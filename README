parrot-linear-algebra

A linear algebra library package for Parrot

PROJECT GOALS

The initial goals of this package are to receive and make independent the
bindings for CBLAS and CLAPACK that were originally developed for the Matrixy
compiler project

OLD: http://code.google.com/p/matrixy
NEW: http://github.com/Whiteknight/matrixy

STATUS
Currently, this package is in an extreme state of disrepair because it is
being separated from the Matrixy project. Nothing works, nothing builds, and
this is expected.

BUILDING

CREDITS
Original versions were developed as part of the Matrixy project by Blairuk.
