parrot-linear-algebra

A linear algebra library package for Parrot

The initial goals of this package are to receive and make independent the
bindings for CBLAS and CLAPACK that were originally developed for the Matrixy
compiler project

OLD: http://code.google.com/p/matrixy
NEW: http://github.com/Whiteknight/matrixy

Development on this projece will proceed in several phases, and has multiple
goals, which may be attacked in concert:

1) Create proper bindings for CBLAS and CLAPACK library routines, including
   translational wrappers to convert Parrot data types into matrices used
   by these libraries
2) Create a proper build system that can find and link to the CBLAS and
   CLAPACK libraries. Possibly even download and build them from source
3) Create a 2-D numerical matrix PMC type that can be used to provide
   low-level access to library routines with minimal conversion
4) Creation of any additonal bindings or wrappers that may be useful to
   high-level language projects

Original versions were developed as part of the Matrixy project by Blairuk.
