parrot-linear-algebra

A linear algebra library package for the Parrot Virtual Machine

PROJECT GOALS

The goals of the Parrot-Linear-Algebra (PLA) project are to develop a good,
high-performance linear algebra toolset for use with the Parrot Virtual
Machine, and programs that run on top of Parrot. In pursuit of these goals,
high-performance PMC matrix types will be developed, along with interfaces
to the BLAS and LAPACK libraries for high-performance operations.

In addition to these core goals, PLA may also provide a series of ancillary
tools that are similar in implementation to it's high-performance core
utilities.

STATUS
PLA is being actively developed. It has core PMC types that build, a build
and installation system, and a growing test suite.

DEPENDENCIES
Currently depends on Parrot (Version 1.6.0 or higher), make, and CBLAS 
(or ATLAS with the CBLAS-like bindings).

BUILDING
Currently builds and installs.

CREDITS
Original versions were developed as part of the Matrixy project by Blairuk.
